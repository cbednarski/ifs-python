    Install From Source

    When the version in the package manager has gone stale, get a fresh,
    production-ready version from a source tarball or precompiled archive.

    Each installation script is called a `source`, identified by a name like
    `nginx`. ifs commands generally operate on these sources e.g. `ifs install
    nginx` or `ifs export nginx`.

    For a list of commands type `ifs ls`. For additional help on any command
    type `ifs COMMAND --help`, e.g. `ifs install --help`.

    Install the specified application.

      ifs install -f --version 1.6.2 nginx

    To inspect an install script before you run it, use `ifs export SOURCE`.

    Versions

    Sources come in three varieties: compiled packages, source packages,
    and repositories. If a source uses a package (tarball, .deb) the install
    script will be locked to a version. You can override it with --version

      ifs install redis --version 2.8.13

    In this case, if you want to upgrade to a new version you can generally
    just specify the latest version when it comes out, e.g.

      ifs install redis --version 2.8.15

    In the third case packages are installed from an apt repo. By default, ifs
    will install the latest version from the repo when you run install. If you
    want to upgrade later, you can pass -f, e.g. `ifs install -f jenkins`. This
    will force ifs to reinstall the latest (essentially upgrading).

    Upstream Patches

    We strive to provide installers for the latest and greatest versions.

    Sometimes the installation dependencies will change and you'll need to
    modify the installer to get the latest version to install. Please submit a
    patch if you fix something! https://github.com/cbednarski/ifs

    Future-proofing Installations

    There are a slew of variables involved in installing packages, including
    updates to dependencies, security fixes, and so forth.

    If you want to guarantee that the version you install doesn't change over
    time, you should probably use a tool like docker. However, you can achieve
    some naive version-locking by using `ifs export SOURCE` for each app you
    install, and checking these files into your version control. When you
    install later, use `ifs source FILENAME` instead of `ifs install SOURCE`.
